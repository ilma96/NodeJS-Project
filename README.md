# NodeJS-Project
This project was the final project for my Internet and Web Technologies course. 
I have created my own server in this program to fetch data from two APIs in a synchronous fashion though I am utilizing asynchronous functions from the NodeJS library. 
My server is getting the requested data from the APIs through a readable stream. 
I have implemented the Observer Pattern here to fire events such as "data", "end", "listening", "request" etc.
